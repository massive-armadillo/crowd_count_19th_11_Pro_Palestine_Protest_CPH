# Assessment of protesters joining the march on 19th Nov 2023, in Copenhagen (Denmark).

###



Method: Jacob's method applied to UAV imagery


We estimated crowd density based on orthoimages (i.e. nadir viewpoint) from UAV and Jacob's method~\cite{choi2015up} these are the images shown in section 1).

Then, we applied the estimated crowd densities to each polygon constituting the march---during the time period 15:51 to 16:00 (this is the surface shown in dir/ ...).


\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A first estimate following the above-mentioned method gives: 37654 $\pm$ 8545 people attended the protest on the 19th November 2023. 
    \item This is the estimate of people filmed in the UAV-footage during the time period 12:49 to 12:59.
\end{itemize}
