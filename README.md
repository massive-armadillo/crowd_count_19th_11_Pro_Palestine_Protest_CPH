# Assessment of protesters joining the march on 19th Nov 2023, in Copenhagen (Denmark).

## Method: Jacob's method applied to UAV imagery

We estimated crowd density based on orthoimages (i.e. top-down viewpoint) from UAV and Jacob's metho. These are the images shown in section 1).

Then, we applied the estimated crowd densities to each polygon constituting the march---during the time period 15:51 to 16:00.
This is the surface shown in the image file Area_filmed_protest_1551.PNG.

Support information is shown in the dir .../circumstantial_evidence.


## Results

The estimate following the above-mentioned method gives: 38100 +- 5000 people were filmed during the protest on the 19th November 2023.

This is the estimate of people filmed in the UAV-footage during the time period 15:51 to 16:00.

## counting people

We used  [DotDotGoose](https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/dotdotgoose/).
DotDotGoose is a free, open source tool to assist with manually counting objects in images.

## density estimates and assumptions

1- We evaluated the density at 10 different locations based on top-down UAV-footage.

2- We asusmed the densities to be Gaussian distributed around its mean (1.2 +- 0.2 people/m^2)
