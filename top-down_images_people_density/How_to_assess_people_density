- First, following Jacob's method [1], we recognized areas with characteristically different people density. 

- We ranked these areas from 1 (ca. 0.85 persons/m$^2$) to 5 (ca. 1.40 persons/m$^2$).

- Then, we assessed the extension of the entire area of the march filmed during the footage (15:51-16:00).
      
- Each area was given a category of people density (from 1 to 5), based on footage. 
      - 2 replicates were done to estimate each density class (types a and b for each density category).
      
- Finally, the density estimates were extrapolated to the area of the entire march.
